**Summary**

Went to work late. Took a while to ramp back up after the weekend and there lots of comments on my CLs. Refactoring took a while, and those CLs also had even more comments. Pretty much grinded the whole day and didn't have much time to do anything else. Went to the gym and met a few friends and then had dinner with Jenny who told me about this app lol. Had a call with Sammer, which I was late to. 

**How I feel**
- Behind at work, a few blockers and setbacks
- Stressed with internship and busy
- Scared that it's almost over

**What next**
- Grind work tomorrow
- Prep for crypto call
- Schedule two coffee chats this week with interns
