**Summary**
Grinded a decent amount today. Definitely felt blocked by backwards looking CL commenst and refactoring. In the future I should plan out the design before tackling the implementation. Had lunch with the team in the sun. Had dinner with [[Hrishav Sapkota]] and just chatted about the future. [[Jenny Sun]] helped me set up obsidian which really nice of her and I appreciate the friendship. Random thought but I want to start making friends that I can see hanging out with my kids or at my wedding some day, if that makes sense. 

**How I feel**
* Stressed about speedy completion
* Feeling like time is running out

**What next**
* Set up calls with people in the team
* Set up calls with other interns 
* Apply to crypto jobs for the Fall
