**Summary**
Talked to Tradable Finance people. Was interesting that they are based out of Africa and had a teammate that exited to Stripe. Had small breakfast and considering IF. Had lunch with team ([[Juan Carlos Mier]], Thalia, Khadija). Had a 1:1 with Nicky and he mentioned I was doing well. Went to the gym and met [[Jenny Sun]] and [[Brandon Vu]]. Had dinner with them two and [[JP Sassine]] talking about crypto. Then I came home and was not so motivated to work on project. 

**How I feel**
- Motivation for working is waning 

**What next**
- Need to grind out google project
- Need to work on Bound to bolster resume + graduate buildspace
- Apply to more crypto companies (superfluid, tradable etc.)
