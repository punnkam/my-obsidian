**Summary**
Went to the office late. Was stuck on a dumb bug for a while. Had lunch with [[JP Sassine]], Manav, and Christian and talked a bunch about crypto. Went to the gym to hit legs, came back home, and went to Castro for dinner with Poom and Derex. Came home to work on Bound and shipped the admin add provider page. 

**How I feel**
- Better about overall project at google
- brain is feeling good
- case for joining crypto startup is bigger than ever

**What next**
- Finish Google project and Bound
- Apply to crypto companies/funds
- Reach out and talk to more people
