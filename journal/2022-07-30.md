**Summary**
Went to work in the morning and then headed to the gym. Then headed to the Blaze Tech BBQ with [[Jenny Sun]] and [[Chrissy Sun]]. Met [[JP Sassine]] there. Walked in and met someone from YC. Also met [[Bryan Chiang]] and a lot of Stanford kids. Talked to [[Brihu Sundararaman]] about his startup with Ryan (host of Blaze bbq) trying to make Etherscan/transactions easy to understand. Talked to [[Will Nida]] who does Plasma research and he wants to get into startups, specifically in optimizing HR and workplace management. Also talked to a bunch of people who were doing B2B SaaS startups in industries that many people aren't looking at. Met a UCSD guy who has a brother at Stanford too. Talked to Anurag who has a startup optimizing building management using AI. Met [[Sigil Wen]] through [[Jenny Sun]]. I can tell he's very smart.

Then went to a party with Princeton, Stanford, and Williams college kids at Apple corporate housing. Met some chill people like [[Riri Jiang]] and [[Max Kan]]. Also talked to [[Emily Cheng]] who happens to know [[Praneet Mekala]]. Some people were working at google, some at apple, and some doing startups. [[Andrew Gannerr]] was especially interesting as we talked about crypto and other startups.

**How I feel**
- want to jump into startups more now
- tech parties could be cool

**What next**
- keep grinding but take on more projects etc.
