**Summary**
Went to work semi-early. Submitted some code and hit my 5k LOC milestone. Went to lunch with the interns Duy, Zach, and Yinka. Met [[Jenny Sun]] at Swich randomly and apparantly she matched with Zach on Bumble LMAO. Went back to work and grinded until going to gym at 5. Met [[Hrishav Sapkota]] and [[Brandon Vu]] at the gym. Went to dinner and got food with [[JP Sassine]] and came home to work a bit.

**How I feel**
* Super comfortable with Google project 
* But need to go above and beyond, not just finish the project
* Also feeling like I'm dropping the ball on crypto a bit recently so should get back to it by applying to jobs and keeping in sync with the crypto world

**What next**
- Get a haircut and feel fresh for the weekend
- Reach out to more people and have more 1:1s
- Try to have lunch/dinner with someone new every week
- Grind Bound for demo day and then wrap it up
