**Summary**
Horrible day. Caroline found out about Megan and we tried to work through it. It's very difficult and the trust is gone. I know I don't deserve any of this but for some reason she thinks I do. I want to do my best to make up to her. But also I can accept the other reality and meet my fate. Spent the whole day at home and my hosts said that was okay, and not to worry about the project.

**How I feel**
like the world's worst perrson

**What next**
- focus on caroline
- get a return, get a job
