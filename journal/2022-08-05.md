**Summary**
Went to SF in the morning today. Enjoyed the bus ride, waking up early, and hopping on the bus with [[Jenny Sun]], [[Brandon Vu]], and Vip (we also saw [[Hrishav Sapkota]] on the way). We had breakfast at the 4th floor cafe in 1MST and that was great. All my hosts [[Grant Beske]] and [[Bhavya Shah]] and manager [[Nikhil Bakshi]] were very understanding of my emergency situation and was happy for me to go back to Thailand. 

At breakfast, I had my first 1:1 with [[Ling Zhong]] which was awesome as I learned about his work in GCloud web3. He told me about Google's edge in crypto and how he wanted to stay because of 1) green card, and 2) being able to work on interesting projects. We plan to set up another call to chat more. Then I had lunch with [[Shanduojiao Jiang (SJ)]] and chatted about crypto, AI, and career. She wasn't into crypto, wants to stay at Google for green card, and have worked at a few startups before. Then I went to game room with [[JP Sassine]] and Adriana. 

Hopped on the bus and met a few people. Sat alone thinking about life and my relationship. Feeling guilty but also feel like I can't just suffer forever. This too shall pass.

**How I feel**
- Felt great about SF
- Felt not great about flying back and the situation
- Wanted to go to the Genesis House
- Want to come back to SF to meet more people and do more things

**What next**
* Need to keep building 
* Increase surface area of luck by grinding 
* Make the most out of the last few weeks
