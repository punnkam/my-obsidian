**Summary**
Presented at the buildspace demo day with AP. Was great to hear feedback and people loved the UI design. We had a bunch of people sign up for the Airtable form to stay in touch. Enjoyed it and we talked about possibly signing up to some incubators/accelerators.

Went to B&B party (Diane, Mike, Josh birthday). Was a super nice house and interesting vibe. Met [[Jenny Sun]], [[Chrissy Sun]], [[Bryan Chiang]], [[Sigil]], and some other people. Some very odd interactions with people and the whole event felt quite off. Was kinda psyched out by the whole thing ngl.

Came home and called Caroline and everything was okay.

**How I feel**
- Imposter syndrome at the party
- Anxious and not enjoyable

**What next**
- Build or work on something so I don't be anxious at these things
- Apply to crypto jobs
- Make it up to Caroline in various ways
