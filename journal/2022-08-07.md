**Summary**
Really enjoyed talking to Caroline this morning and she's making me change to be a better man, boyfriend, and person. Went to work at Bay View. Applied to some crypto positions but also want to continue building out Bound. Haven't reached out to last resort crypto connects for jobs. Ate Thai food at Castro for dinner with Poom. 

Was not very bullish on the idea of Bound until thinking more about it. Gonna apply to accelerators and see what happens. Thinking about recruiting more people if we get into an accelerator program ([[Prathik Malireddy]], [[Kunal Arora]] etc.). 

**How I feel**
- Accomplished and productive
- Feel like I'm getting back into my grind groove after last week's emotional rollercoaster

**What next**
- Apply to more accelerators/incubators
- Check out Drips and potentially fork/play around with it
- Do Encode Advanced bootcamp
- Attend more events like the one on Sat to get out my comfort zone
