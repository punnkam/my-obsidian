**Summary**
Had a decent start to the week. Talked to Paolo the PM on the team and he provided some great insight about playing to one's strengths. He does not have an engineering background and progressed through his career by building relationships and finding people he can trust and work with them effectively. 

Then had a quick lunch with Zach and worked for the rest of the day. Went to the gym and saw [[Brandon Vu]]. Grabbed dinner togo and left. Felt bad for not giving [[Jenny Sun]] a ride but she was having dinner with someone else and I had to go home to submit my accelerator apps for Bound.

**How I feel**
- Good about project but want to exceed expectations by getting Superroot fetch and maybe some UI implemented, along with dashboard of stats 
- Feeling okay about Bound. Idea definitely has legs but questioning whether [[Alex Phan]] and I can pull it off. 
- Need to apply to more crypto projects and begin to reach out to existing connects

**What next**
- Apply to more crypto projects
- Talk to more crypto people at google
- Grind code and cold dms
