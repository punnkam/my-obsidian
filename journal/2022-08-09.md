**Summary**
Talked to [[Oliver King]] in the morning. He gave me very valuable advice. He mentioned that anywhere I go, I should spend time learning everything from first principles, and build up strong foundational knowledge before executing on anything. 

Talked to [[Alex Phan]] about Bound and reflected on whether I wanted to commit. I personally don't feel totally confident about jumping in because of our lack of experience and technical skills. 

**How I feel**
- Want to get a crypto job for the Fall
- Great and chill

**What next**
- Grind hard reach out to crypto projectst
- Finish strong at Google
