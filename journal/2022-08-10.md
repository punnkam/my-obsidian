**Summary**
A lot of blockers at work today so took the opportunity to learn as much Rust as possible. Still have ways to go but slowly getting there. Want to learn as much as I can before coffee chat on Saturday. CPI printed lower. Not sure what that means as a whole but we may get a nice pump before we absolutely get rekt. 

Had lunch with [[Jenny Sun]] and Vip. Went back to work and went to the gym at the same time. Saw [[Brandon Vu]] and met some guy in TKE fom St-Louis. All in all chill day, had dinner with roommates and came home. 

**How I feel**
- Great about Google
- Need to grind hard for crypto
- Looking forward to next yearr

**What next**
- Grind crypto
- Apply to jobs (throwaway -> legit)
- Start conceptualizing Bound and building out something
