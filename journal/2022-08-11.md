**Summary**
Worked on primarily debugging today. A lot of perms issues messing things up but was able to put in 2 CLs that potentially fixed some bugs. Nicky was OP at fixing a difficult bug toward the end of the day. [[Grant Beske]] helped out a lot and I'm super grateful for it. 

Went to the gym and saw [[Jenny Sun]] and sent her home after dinner (eaten at my desk). Saw Alex's idea for Bound and was not a big fan of the idea. 

**How I feel**
- Feel okay about project, confident about finish but not confident about stretch
- Feel much better at internship, feel focused and developing as a peson
- Don't feel the need to constantly look at people

**What next**
- Need to prep crypto for chat tomorow
- Need to prep Rust for chat Saturday
- Apply to jobs this weekend
