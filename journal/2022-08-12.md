**Summary**
Went to work and did some debugging. Access issues turned out to be a massive bitch so we resorted to testing things in staging (binary before prod). After fixes from yesterday were pushed, I got an RpcContext error. Couldn't figure it out so went to lunch with [[Hrishav Sapkota]], and then met [[JP Sassine]] near my desk later in the day. 

After lunch, I sent a fix and [[Grant Beske]] helped cherrypick. It worked nicely but now the footprints didn't seem to contain the right information. Wrapped up in the evening and went to the arcade [[Bryan Chiang]], [[Jenny Sun]], and [[Chrissy Sun]]. Then we went to the gym and talked about ZK-applications in gaming, then went to CL to order food. I just went to grab chipotle and go home. 

**How I feel**
- Feel pretty good about project now that it's really close to being ramped up
- Enjoyed chatting about crypto with [[Bryan Chiang]]

**What next**
- Apply to more crypto
- Do takehome assignments
- Learn Rust/Move
- Learn ZK?
