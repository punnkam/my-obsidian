**Summary**
Picked up [[Alex Phan]] from the airport. Then went for a coffee chat with [[Paul Sengh]] and learned about Delta One. He's planning to make it a hedge fund pretty much. Want to grow the Eth side, and want to develop the optics side of the product. 

Then, went to play basketball at some rec center in Fremont with [[Bryan Chiang]], [[Jenny Sun]], [[Chrissy Sun]], and [[Alex Phan]]. Then we had dinner with some Princeton people, saw the Meta corporate housing, and came back. Talked to [[Bryan Chiang]] about why he doesn't feel like raising. Analogy used was wanted to aim the rocket in the right direction/degrees before filling it up with fuel and launching.
