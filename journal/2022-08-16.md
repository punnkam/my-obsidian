**Summary**
Went to work. Had some trouble with debugging but figuring it out. Had lunch with Zach and chatted about random stuff. Went to SF with [[Alex Phan]] and [[Jenny Sun]]. Played type racer on the bus. Jenny brought [[Ali Debow]] to the Google office and it was enjoyable to meet her and talk about HK7s and international schools.
