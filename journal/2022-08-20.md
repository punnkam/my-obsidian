**Summary**
Worked on Rust at bay view. Went to [[Sigil]]'s birthday party @neogenesis and met [[Jenny Sun]], [[Bryan Chiang]], [[Chrissy Sun]], and a bunch of fun people. Then went to see [[Ishaan Hiranandani]] and met two of his friends at google and ex-pres of BAM. 

**How I feel**
- Feel generally good
- Want to talk to Sigil more to learn about him
- Feel a bit out of place still

**What next**
- Get on a grind and build stuff
- Only way to learn to to build
- Be impatient with action and patient with results
