**Summary**
Went to work. Had a team presentation which people enjoyed. [[Tuan Nguyen]] gave me a peer bonus which felt great, and was congratulated by the rest of the team. Talked to [[JP Sassine]] about his roommate's friend dating Waylan from Harvard crypto. Then hit the gym and came back to prep for Euler call.

**How I feel**
- Need to prep for calls to make them work out
- Feel like I could train myself to be more discipline (lock myself in a room or lock my phone outside the room)

**What next**
- Talk to more founders
- Expand network while here
- Taking action (act on inspiration)
