**Summary**
Fixed bloom filter bug today. Talked to [[Michael Bentley]] who was very nice and verbrally offerred an internship position at Euler. 

Nicky said I could finish superroot and connect with GWS for VE logging and then we can bug bash next Friday.

Went to grab dinner with [[Raymond Chong]] and talked about trading, building, and general crypto stuff. 

**How I feel**
- Feel great about Euler but don't want to get ahead of myself

**What next**
* Need to grind for it to prove myself
- Think like the founder
- Spend less time at the gym
- Learn Rust and deep dive on AMM code
