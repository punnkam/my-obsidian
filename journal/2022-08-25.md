**Summary**
Hard at work today. Gettting more on my plate as the superroot stuff is nearing completion. Think I can finish superrroot by tomorrrow and maybe bugbash end of next week. 

Had first BaSD meeting of the year. Low attendance but lots of cool plans ahead. Need to text eduDAO. Lead some projects.

**How I feel**
- Feel great overall about Google (busy but good busy) - Need to wrap up docs 
- Excited about Euler and working with their team
- Feeling meh about situation with le lady but need to stick it through to see how it goes because relationships are everything and are what gives meaning to life

**What next**
- Keep grinding Google (get docs done asap)
- Read up and learn as much as possible (know math at a solid level)
- Learn Rust and build something because it's easy to go to Move after
