**Summary**
Stuck on bug and frustrated. Had offsite with team at Thai restaurant and chatted a lot with [[Grant Beske]] and [[Juan Carlos Mier]]. Zach's last day. Then went to gym and ate dinner with [[JP Sassine]] at Castro.

**2 things I feel**
- Frustrated that I can't fix a simple bug
- Bittersweet about leaving Google

**1 thing I learned**
- I was stuck on implementing Rpc mock calls in Superroot. But as I kept going at it I was able to figure most of it out on my own. Lesson in that is I can do it if I want it bad enough.

**What next**
- Work with [[Bhavya Shah]] on the superroot bug
- Talk to [[Michael Bentley]] about Euler
- Learn Rustt
