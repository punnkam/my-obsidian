**Summary**
Still stumped by superroot bug after working on it all day. Went for dinner with [[JP Sassine]] and [[Brandon Vu]]. Then went to Sunnyvale office after to shoot some hoops. 

**2 things I feel**
- Feels good to decompress after having a hard time with a bug
- Scared of not doing anything my last weekend but also not too stressed about it since I'll be back

**1 thing I learned**
- Going at a bug doesn't help much without context and I could just be wasting time. Focus on other things and figure out the bug witht context.

**What next**
- Finish presentation slides and start intern doc
- Chat on Monday with [[Michael Bentley]]
- Breakfast tomorrow with [[Imran Matin]]
- Learn Rust
