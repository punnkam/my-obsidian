**Summary**
First day at Banyan. Did some work on Euler and understand the codebase a lot more. Taking on some Jira tasks.

**2 things I feel**
- Slowly getting up to speed
- Still feel behind and need to learn some of the math

**1 thing I learned**
- You will eventually get rich, you just need to keep at it and don't think about it.

**What next**
