**Summary**
Read System design. Understand big picture of how to scale to millions of users. 

* Creating a rate limiter in API layer and using shared state to enable distributedness. Most used algorithm is coin buckets where each bucket is replished with N coins after each multiple of T time.
* Creating a consistent hashing technique to increase uniformity of traffic distribution across servers and prevent the "celebrity" problem. Uses a hash ring and place hashed servers around the ring, adds hashed keys around the ring, and routing traffic of a key to the closest server node clockwise. Improved on using virtual nodes where each server can be split into multiple nodes to even the distribution of servers on the ring.
* Create a unique ID generator using snowflake method where bits are split into sign bit, timestamp bits, datacenter bits, server bits, and sequence bits.
