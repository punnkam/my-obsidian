**Braindump**
Dropped one class today. Initially felt like it was a cowardly thing to do to give up like that. But also felt like I had many things on my plate (Euler, Job apps, BaSD), which made me feel like I made the right choice. 

Caroline left and I feel somewhat lonely, but it's nice to have alone time and be on a heavy grind. Definitely was a slow start to the day and a slow day in general, possibly becase of waking up late. 

**Feelings**
- Hyped to grind as much as possible
- A bit lonely
- Need to increase productivity

**Learnings**
