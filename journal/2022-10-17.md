**Braindump**
very efficient today. worked on coin flip contract a lot and got stuck on some of it. Worked on euler and got stuck on making txn.

**Feelings**
- Overwhelmed by the sheer number of things to do
- Feeling like not doing much at Euler --> contributing to a lot of the anxiety

**Learnings**
- call, delegatecall, fallback functions
- create2
- calldata and encoding with params packing
- bitpacking
	- structs and enums have their own slots
	- address is 20 bytes
	- uint8 is 1 byte each

**What next**

	- > 45 minutes of exercise
	- No alcohol or weed
- Pillars
	- Job
		- Euler
		- Recruiting -- OAs/LC
