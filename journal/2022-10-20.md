**Braindump**
Neo event was embarassingly shit.

Spent a long time working on House and didn't get it to work. Spent a long time on flashbots and didn't get that to work either.

**Feelings**
- incompetent as a solidity dev lmao

**Learnings**
- Instead of just keeping on running and checking errors, try to get to root of the problem first, because that will allow me to figure out the problem and not run into it again.
