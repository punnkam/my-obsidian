**Braindump**
Met [[Leo Lu]] and talked about crypto. Talked about his journey and how he got started with DeLiquid and Chataverse. YC was only a 10 minute interview and very people oriented. They bet on people more than the idea/business model. 

**Feelings**
- Want to do startup more now

**Learnings**
- Need to establish equity shares and roles at a startup before seeking funding and YC. People skills are very important and should keep it up.
