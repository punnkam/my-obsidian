**Braindump**
Absolutely nuked the CSE107 quiz today. First mistake, studied last minute. Second mistake, forgot to bring slides. Feels horrible but need to learn to take losses better and learn from them. 

**Feelings**
- Bad about nuking quiz
- But productive with Euler, back on the FE

**Learnings**
- debugger in js/ts allows you to stop execution at that point
