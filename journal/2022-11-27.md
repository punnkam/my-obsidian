**Braindump**
Worked on hw today. Cold start but got going. Also worked on some euler. Had dinner downstairs with Z and satvik which was nice. 

**Feelings**
- Not good about derm
- Not great about Euler but also not bad
- Good about project
- Meh about school

**Learnings**
- Ethers config and internal library functions
- Had a realization
	- The realistic end goal before taking building a startup or business is the acquire enough confidence that I can learn anything fast and do it well. 
	- Take a similar approach to an ex-Navy SEAL or Marine. Many skills vets find success in business because of their ability to embrace discomfort. From training and war, they know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. If they were to die at that moment, they should give it everything they can. So we, as non-war-fighting-techbros, should do the same. 
	- Gain the ability to be comfortable with discomfort, and pour your heart into what you end up pursuing.
