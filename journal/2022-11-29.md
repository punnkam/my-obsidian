**Braindump**
Talked to a bunch of people today. First talked to 107 classmate and caught up, that was fun. Then talked to lady at seed and sprout and felt good. Then was super active at the event talking to people and I really enjoyed it. Moral of the story is to just be more social to be happy.

Talked to mom as well about her firm. Basically motivational speeching her haha. Then sent Sammer home.

**Feelings**
* Felt great today being more social (should do that more)

**Learnings**
- Friends are important
	- Have to invest in them (time and effort)
	- They can help you spot things you didn't see, tell you things you don't want to hear, support what you're not good at
	- It really is about the friends you make along the way
- Mentorship is very important
	- Network and it will happen organically
	- Every time you meet with this guy - what can I do for you?
	- introduce myself everywhere to people that I don't know
