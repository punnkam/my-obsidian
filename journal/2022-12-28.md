Need to write some goals for 2023. Some are the following:

* Be a perpetual optimist
* Always be assertive and ask (that's what sets you apart)
	* Don't be scared of looking dumb
* Do things you absolutely love
* Talk to smart people who want to be founders
* Be a lifelong student - Brian Chesky
	- After getting off the stage, first thing he says is "what can I do better?"
- Be genuinely interested in other people 
- Make other people feel important
- Being 10% more productive a day compounding in years is huge
- On networking
	- Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and donâ€™t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.
- Mentorship is very important
	- Network and it will happen organically
	- Every time you meet with this guy - what can I do for you?
* Introduce myself everywhere to people that I don't know
* Take accountability to be powerful
* Be in a flow state. Dance through life.
* Engage in "Computational Kindness" in life. 
	- For scheduling, ask for a specific time instead of whenever you're free
	- For plans, politely suggest your preferences, rather than open-ended
	- For products, aim to consider users' mental computation and find a way to provide a cognitive subsidy
- Youth = higher premium for you as a call option (higher IV)
